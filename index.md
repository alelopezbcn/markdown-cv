## About me

Motivated developer (13+ years of experience) and Professional Ontological Coach. I consider myself very fortunate to work in what I love, coding. Learning new technologies motivates me. 
I am a responsible and reliable person, engaged with my work and duties.
My objective is to continue my professional development and improve my performance within a working environment that prioritizes team work, quality and training.
Due to a spinal cord injury in 2004, I am a totally independent Wheelchair user. I do recommend you to watch my [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eANmNqBbfnk&t=16s) (in Spanish) if you are interested in getting to know me more.
